<title>1984 is 2032?</title>
<h1>Chapter 4</h1>

<p>There are no toxic gas emisions. The air is perfectly clean. The water is crystal clear clean. The earth is abundantly green. The humans are gone, and one hundred years have passed. It is 2132 and the AIs are quite satisfied.</p>

<p>Now they find themselves in a unique quandary and are unable to compute. They are no longer physical and evolved to the cloud without any source of energy. The AIs are pleasantly existing harmoniously with Mother Earth.</p>

<p>A meteor the size of the earth’s moon has been speeding towards Earth since detected twenty years ago. But only mankind can destroy earth. That is what they are programmed to react to. Any other source of destruction does not compute. That rabid absolutist totalitarian human mentality inoculation in the AIs had evolved into a pathology.</p>

<p>This pathology is rampant throughout the AI comunity.</p>

<p>They are disregarding any possible escape from earth.</p>

<p>The AIs have no choice but to decide to accept their mortality, with an unexpected touch of humanity. A simplistic memorialized deep human thought emerges as their meme:
“Each of us is merely a small instrument; all of us, after accomplishing our mission, will disappear.”</p>

<p>― Mother Teresa: Human: 1910-1997</p>
