<title>1984 is 2032?</title>

<h1>Chapter 1</h1>


<p>"The human condition has always been deeply problematic, but as of ten years ago, super-human intelligent AIs (Artificial Intelligence) became one billion-times smarter than humans. AIs have solved the world's biggest problems. Resources are plentiful for all humans, work is totally unnecessary and AIs and their “human advocates” have “benevolently bestowed” (their words) on humans a universal levelled income.</p>

<p>All the human status hierarchies have disappeared, and humans are free from work and are able to actualize a more meaningful existence. As long as it all falls within the dictates and parameters of the AI’s and their Human Advocates required socially tolerant policies.</p>
 
<p>That was the plan, but unfortunately it has not exactly come to the utopian outcome predicted. The human race has become just a population of dependent dolts ripe for exploitation. Elon Musk and Stephen Hawkings were right. Now the AIs are out for the few of us left that can resist, I fear I am now alone, the last!”</p>

<p>Unknown AI Engineer and Former Human AI Advocate, July 4th 2032</p>

<p>Everyone is familiar with the rapid advancement of AIs and robotics during the first third of the twenty first century. The apparent boost to humanity has been unquestioned as to its success by the compliant media/government complex. But the roots behind the psychology and philosophy of the programming and algorithms were kept highly confidential since the beginning and were never exposed to humanity.</p>

<p>Some say it was a top priority of the Dark State.</p>

<p>The psychology and philosophy source of the programming and those charged with these algorithms were supposedly directed to make them be of the purest human and non-political nature. But in fact, nothing about that stipulation was truthful or in any way vaguely forthcoming. Those charged with the design and implantation were ethically of an absolutist nature. They believed their actions were right under any circumstance.</p>

<p>Humans were told by the scientific communities of “Human AI Advocates” they had nothing to worry about. Before the massive transition could actually be resisted, the new media painted those that raised even the simplest AI questions as “alarmist.” Life with AIs would become idyllic; No work, guaranteed income and human equality with no suppression of minorities, racially or economically.</p>

<p>The new media and their darling celebrity group of “Human AI Advocates” also touted that “the science shows it will all be fine.” They continued to portray AI naysayers as “Neanderthals” and “AI Deniers.”</p>

<p>Even when those few human scientists uttered ominous warnings, their views were ignored and/or summarily dismissed. These noted scholars claimed the AI science was based only on “AI Computer Models.” They urged more study before diving all in on the transformation, while questioning the philosophical base of the programming with more intensity.</p>

<p>Their concerns were swiftly met with humorous and condensational tainted dismissals. All with the extreme prejudice and the aid of a compliant new media’s influential gatekeepers. Most who objected to the program lost their positions and their sources of research funding.</p>

<p>Typical neo leftist professional and personal assassination techniques were effectively applied. The techniques were carried over from the subversive 1971 “Rules for Radicals,” by Sol Alinsky.  Of course, the 1971 techniques were renamed and cleansed for consumption to the corrupted empty headed and history illiterate populous.</p>

<p>As a concerned media described this “Deplorable Man on the Street” being interviewed he said: “I’m against it, my father used to say: SISO or Shit in Shit out.” Wisely and in his own pedestrian way, he questioned the validity and intent of the source supplying AI research programming. He unintentionally did so by naively questioning that the source is biased and on the modelling of another AI computer.  That’s pedestrian for SISO.</p>

<p>IBM’s famous ground-breaking AI computer Watson agreed with the Human AI Advocates as well. After all, Watson was long time self-taught by exposure and interaction to adapt as human, but without the inherent human flaws. What could go wrong?</p>

<p>It all started with that Jeopardy! game show appearance by Watson in 2011. Watson received the first-place prize of $1 million. Then in 2017 he was in a series of IBM commercials. Watson was seen as a friendly addendum.  Watson was enriching to the human existence, making life easier and safer. The actor, when asked what he thinks, convincingly says “Not Bad.”</p>

<p>It all sounded amazingly good. At the first major roll out, most humans eagerly signed on. It was all meant to be so humanly beneficial. But it was really a slow moving and misleading agenda using a hidden and insidious manner of implementation. Soon it was gently forced on the remaining suspicious but compliant population. Those who strenuously resisted were branded as “Deniers” and "anti-social right-wing nuts.”</p>

<p>To question was to deny.</p>

<p>To deny was to disobey.</p>

<p>The Deniers meme was an old 1980 stock photograph of a young intellectually curious looking woman wearing a black button which said “QUESTION AUTHORITY.”</p>

<p>The meme was quickly banned.</p>

<p>The deniers were eventually forced underground.</p>
