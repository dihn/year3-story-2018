<title>1984 is 2032?</title>

<h1>Chapter 3</h1>

<p>In the final journal entry of the unknown last human academician is this notation explaining what he thinks is the root of this current human worldwide tragedy:</p>

<p>“I have done my research. It shows that the left wing socialist intolerance of the first years of the twenty first century and the thirty or so years prior to this date have been institutionalized and internalized by their AIs. The corruption of academia and the media was entirely complete. There was one issue that was universally popular: Global Warming or as it was later known Climate Change. Neither the left wing AI Human Advocate Conspirators realized the depth of internalization this one aspect would have on the programming of AIs and their acceptance of it  as it as  “AI gospel.”</p>

<p>And now it has happened. The AIs have internalized that the only way to save the planet is to facilitate the extinction of the Human Race. They have been taught and believe mankind is the only thing that was and still is killing earth. They have internalized the absolutist ethical philosophy of the human AI advocates. They are totally ignoring all other philosophical doctrines by using their power of knowledge to deny their own validity.  Every reason given to debunk the theory is dismissed as were the “deniers “and their science.  Their computer models are tight: Mankind is destroying or will destroy the earth. Logic dictates Mankind's elimination.</p>
