<title>1984 is 2032?</title>
<h1>Chapter 4 - Alternative Ending</h1>

<p>There are no toxic gas emissions. The air is perfectly clean. The water is crystal clear clean. The earth is abundantly green. The AIs are gone, and one hundred years have passed. It is 2132 and after many years of war and turmoil the humans have finally conquered the AI overlords and can live in peace.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the humans of earth a meteor is plummeting to earth at ever increasing speeds. Before the great AI war the humans had relied on the AIs to find solutions to issues just like this. Now the humans are out of their depth as they had become mentally lazy and creatively stagnant after relying on AI and technology to do their thinking for them.</p>

<p>People have now begun to realise that the people who were warning of the detrimental effects to their minds of having their technology remember all information for them, to organise their days and inform them of how best to make decisions on the most mundane of problems, were not in fact luddites, but people who had the foresight to see how these technologies would change the world forever and not in a positive manner.</p>

<p>Now with the earths continued existence hanging by a thread, one is left to wonder whether humans can regain what has been lost for so long so that they can continue to exist in this universe.</p>
