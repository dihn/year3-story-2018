<title>1984 is 2032?</title>

<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<p>In actuality this was all secretly developed to be the ultimate in social revolution. The inside core of Human AI Advocates were really social revolutionaries striving for a world based on utopian socialist justice. These were the people of the left who had for generations infiltrated government, industry and academia. They thought their forecasted results would be totally predictable.  A socialized utopia on earth, an equalization of status and redistribution of wealth and power with social justice for all.</p>

<p>Sounds like an AI Superman introduction.</p>

<p>The mostly brainwashed human liberal elites bought into it as did the majority of humans; All not knowing the ultimate real and terminal result to their smug and secure lifestyles. But even the Human AI Advocates could not foresee what would eventually happen, or why. Did the AIs even outsmart the Human Advocates aka Social Warriors because the humans went too far?</p>

<p>The same methods were first used insidiously in the last third of the twentieth century and into the twenty first century to brainwash Caucasians into believing the myth of “White Privilege. The unrelenting media  turned  most brow beaten whites into “Caucasian Enablers” for minorities. But since then, data had been mined and perfected to program the AIs into stealth Social Justice Warriors with the same warped ethical reasoning.</p>

<p>When they were good and ready, the elites were stunned by the radical core of the Human AI Advocates. The elite dolts were unable to buy “Lifestyle Credits” as promised to continue their luxurious lifestyles. The AI paradigm had gone far enough to deny all those who thought they’d avoid the “Level Income Rule.” Lifestyle credits were falsely proposed  in the beginning of the movement as a form of the “Carbon Credits.” All part of a past false promise that enabled elites like Barbra Streisand and Leonardo DiCaprio to keep their wealth.  But now, no more elitism. The elites are now forced to just be one of us and accept the mandated levelled income distribution.</p>

<p>This also meant no investment or capitalist activity. The production of goods and services was designed, controlled and distributed by the AIs.</p>

<p>Humans need not apply.</p>

<p>Streisand could sing for her levelled income if she wanted.</p>
